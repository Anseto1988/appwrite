## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK with minimum API 26
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anseto1988/appwrite.git
   cd snacktrack
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to the cloned directory

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `env.template` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp env.template .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` file and add your Appwrite credentials:
     ```
     APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-instance.com/v1
     APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
     APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
     APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   
   **Important Security Notes:**
   - Never commit the `.env` file to version control
   - Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
   - Use different API keys for development and production
   - The `.env` file is automatically excluded in `.gitignore`

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

6. **Run the app**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click "Run" in Android Studio or use:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew installDebug
     ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Test business logic and ViewModels
- **Integration Tests**: Test repository and API interactions
- **UI Tests**: Test user interface and navigation

Run all tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Building for Release

1. Update version in `app/build.gradle.kts`
2. Build release APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
3. Sign the APK with your release key
4. Test on multiple devices
5. Upload to Google Play Store

## OAuth Configuration

If your app uses OAuth authentication (e.g., Google Sign-In), you'll need to configure the callback URL:

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**
   - The callback scheme is currently set to `appwrite-callback-snackrack2`
   - If using a different project ID, update the scheme in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
     ```xml
     <data android:scheme="appwrite-callback-YOUR_PROJECT_ID" />
     ```

2. **Configure OAuth Provider**
   - Add these redirect URIs in your OAuth provider console:
     - `https://your-appwrite-endpoint/v1/account/sessions/oauth2/callback/google/YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
     - `appwrite-callback-YOUR_PROJECT_ID://auth`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gradle sync fails**
   - Check `gradle.properties` for correct JDK path
   - Ensure you have JDK 11 or higher

2. **Appwrite connection errors**
   - Verify endpoint URL in `.env` file
   - Check API key configuration in `.env` file
   - Ensure network permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Verify all environment variables are properly set

3. **Build errors**
   - Clean and rebuild: `./gradlew clean build`
   - Invalidate caches in Android Studio
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with all required variables
