## Coding Standards

### Kotlin Style Guide
We follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with these additions:

```kotlin
// Class naming
class DogRepository // Pascal case

// Function naming
fun calculateNutrition() // Camel case

// Constants
const val MAX_DOG_COUNT = 10 // Screaming snake case

// Package structure
com.example.snacktrack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils
```

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Remove commented-out code before committing

### Android Best Practices
- Use ViewModel for UI state management
- Follow MVVM architecture pattern
- Use Kotlin coroutines for async operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Support configuration changes

## Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for clear history:

### Format
```
[ISSUE-XXX] type: description

Longer explanation if needed

Closes #XXX
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```
[ISSUE-123] feat: Add barcode scanning functionality

Implemented camera permission handling and barcode detection
using ML Kit. Includes error handling and user feedback.

Closes #123
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. Update your branch with latest `develop`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/develop
   ```
2. Run all tests: `./gradlew test`
3. Run lint: `./gradlew lint`
4. Ensure build passes: `./gradlew build`

### PR Requirements
- Title format: `[ISSUE-XXX] Type: Brief description`
- Link to related issue(s)
- Description of changes
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Test instructions
- Checklist completion

### Review Process
1. Automated checks must pass
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all feedback
4. Maintainer merges when approved

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain 80% code coverage
- Use MockK for mocking
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example:
```kotlin
@Test
fun `calculateCalories returns correct value`() {
    // Arrange
    val food = Food(calories = 100, amount = 50)
    
    // Act
    val result = nutritionCalculator.calculateCalories(food)
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals(50, result)
}
```

### Integration Tests
- Test API interactions
- Test database operations
- Use test fixtures for consistent data

### UI Tests
- Test critical user flows
- Use Espresso for UI testing
- Test on multiple screen sizes

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms
- Include examples in documentation

```kotlin
/**
 * Calculates the daily nutrition requirements for a dog
 * based on weight, age, and activity level.
 *
 * @param dog The dog to calculate nutrition for
 * @return NutritionRequirements object with daily values
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if dog weight is invalid
 */
fun calculateNutritionRequirements(dog: Dog): NutritionRequirements
```

### README Updates
- Update README for significant features
- Keep setup instructions current
- Add new dependencies to documentation
